# Mobile Flashcards Project

For the UdaciCards project, you will build a mobile application 
(Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of 
flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of 
flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, 
then take quizzes on those decks.

In the application, users are able to create deck quizes,
add question to those decks.
At the end of the quiz user will see the final score for the quiz.
